### Installation

The preferred method is to add this package directly into your Meteorite's `smart.json` package file:

```javascript
{
  "packages": {
    "meteor-metainspector" : { 
	"branch" : "master",
	"git" : "https://github.com/electricjesus/meteor-metainspector.git"
    }
  }
}
```

Then run `mrt install`.


Or you could install via [Atmosphere](http://atmosphere.meteor.com/): `mrt add lunr`

### Don't have Meteorite, yet?

It's easy! Just run `sudo -H npm install -g meteorite` (provided you already have the latest Node/NPM). For more info visit this page:
